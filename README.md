# Handwritten Digit Recognition with Python

This repository contains the code and resources for investigating handwritten digit recognition using the Arabic Handwritten Digits Dataset with Python. Three models were implemented and compared:

1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):** Utilized for feature extraction and digit classification.
2. **Artificial Neural Network (ANN):** Focused on fully connected layers for accurate classification.
3. **Random Forest:** Applied ensemble learning to enhance classification accuracy.

## Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore different machine learning models for recognizing handwritten digits. The project includes:

- **Data Exploration:** Analyzing the Arabic Handwritten Digits Dataset to understand its structure and characteristics.
- **Model Implementation:** Implementing three different models in Python to perform digit recognition.
- **Model Comparison:** Evaluating and comparing the performance of the implemented models.
- **GUI Application Development:** Creating a user-friendly GUI application for real-time digit recognition, incorporating data processing and visualization.

## Key Components

- **Python Scripts:** Contains the code for implementing the CNN, ANN, and Random Forest models.
